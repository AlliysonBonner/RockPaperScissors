# Rock Paper Scissors Game
![A cartoon of two young men locked in an aggressive match of Rock, Paper, Scissors.](https://github.com/AlliysonBonner/RockPaperScissors/blob/main/image.png?raw=true)
This is a simple implementation of the popular hand game Rock Paper Scissors. The game is played between two players, where each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). "Scissors" is identical to the two-fingered V sign (also indicating "victory" or "peace") except that it is pointed horizontally instead of being held upright in the air.

## Getting Started
To run the game, simply run the play() function in the terminal.

## Rules
In this game, rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.
